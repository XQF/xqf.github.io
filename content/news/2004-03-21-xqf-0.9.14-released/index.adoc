XQF 0.9.14 has been released! Please see the ChangeLog for full details and credits.

Here is the list of what's new - some of which were only available previously by downloading the CVS version:

* New games: UT2004, Postal2, BF1942(wine). All without official master.
* Improved --launch parameter. Now only requires IP address and asks for type if needed. It's possible now to use this together with e.g. XChat.
* Add --add parameter to just add a server to favorites
* Fix LAN browsing
* Add LAN masters by default
* Support password on Savage servers
* New server properties: Comment and "this server sucks"
* Add exec function for Hexenworld (anyone ever played that game?)
* Switch to intltool for i18n
* Install desktop files
